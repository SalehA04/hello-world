My name is Muhammad Saleh Arshad, I prefer to by Saleh. I am eighteen years old & I'm studying at South East Technological University (SETU). The course that I am studying right now is BSc in Software Systems Development. I enjoy working with computers and that is one of the main reasons why I had chosen this course.
